The master file is GMSK_modulator_demodulator.m run it and give the commands as needed to get the SNR to BER curve.

Here only a 26 bit training sequence is transmitted and received multiple times depending on the number of iterations given. 

Download and run directly in MATLAB.

To use this file in OCTAVE (tried on OCTAVE 4.0):

Install Packages once after installing OCTAVE
